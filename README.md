# Credit Score Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project for **credit score classification**.  
The goal is to develop accurate models to classify credit scores using a dataset that includes demographic and financial data.

## üìå Project Overview
This project involves:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, and feature selection).
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Training and optimizing machine learning models.
- Evaluating model performance using classification metrics.

## üìÇ Dataset Information
- **File Name:** `credit_score_data.csv` 
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Credit Score Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification)
- **License:** CC0: Public Domain
- **Description:** Contains demographic and financial data such as annual income, customer age, and payment history.
- **Format:** CSV file

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:

| Library  | Usage |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|

üìä Usage Instructions

1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the dataset:
Go to Kaggle Dataset.
Download the dataset and place it in the same directory as the project files.
Rename it to credit_score_data.csv if necessary.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or another IDE.
Make sure the dataset is correctly placed in the same directory.
Execute the cells sequentially:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Train and evaluate the models.

üöÄ Results & Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated based on metrics like F1-score, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna improves model performance.
Visualizations and reports are included in the notebook for deeper insights.
